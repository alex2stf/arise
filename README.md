Advices for devs:
arise is a small compilable codebase and doesn't respect all the java community standards

####A.R.I.S.E is...
- not your average architecture model
- full of nested classes
- full of single-letter variables
- compiled, run and tested on raspberry pi, Windows XP and low CPU architectures
- aiming to provide big and useful features using a few lines of code
